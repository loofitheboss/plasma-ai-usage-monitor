## Research Notes

### AI API Monitoring Landscape (2026)

Key trends informing this roadmap:

1. **Provider proliferation** — The AI provider market has fragmented. Users commonly juggle 5-10 providers simultaneously. Provider-agnostic monitoring is essential.

2. **Subscription tool explosion** — AI coding assistants (Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Claude Code, Codex, JetBrains AI, Tabnine) all have different quota models. Users need unified tracking.

3. **Cost unpredictability** — With token-based pricing, reasoning models (o1, o3, DeepSeek R1), and variable output lengths, monthly AI costs are hard to predict. Forecasting is a top user request.

4. **Team cost management** — Organizations struggle to track per-developer AI spending. Chargeback and allocation tooling is immature at the individual level.

5. **Local AI growth** — Ollama has become mainstream for local inference. Users want to compare local (electricity) vs cloud (API) costs for the same model families.

6. **Multi-modal expansion** — Video (Veo, Sora), image (DALL-E, Midjourney), and audio (ElevenLabs) APIs add new cost dimensions beyond text tokens.

7. **Compliance requirements** — Enterprise teams increasingly need audit trails, usage policies, and export capabilities for AI cost governance.

### Competitive Analysis

| Tool | Platform | Providers | Local AI | Forecasting | Team |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|-------------|------|
| **This widget** | KDE Plasma 6 | 10 + 3 subs | No | No | No |
| OpenAI Dashboard | Web | OpenAI only | No | No | Org-level |
| Helicone | Web (SaaS) | Proxy-based | No | Yes | Yes |
| LangSmith | Web (SaaS) | LangChain ecosystem | No | Limited | Yes |
| LiteLLM | CLI/Web | Proxy-based | No | No | Yes |
| Portkey | Web (SaaS) | Gateway-based | No | Yes | Yes |

**Our differentiation:** Native desktop widget (always visible), no proxy/gateway required (direct API polling), subscription tool tracking, fully offline/local, open source, KDE-native UX.

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Provider API changes | Medium | Version-pinned API clients, graceful degradation |
| Browser sync breakage | High | Abstraction layer, multiple extraction backends, user warnings |
| KDE Plasma API changes | Low | Pin to stable KF6 APIs, test against Plasma 6.x releases |
| Feature bloat | Medium | Strict version scoping, user-configurable feature toggles |
| Cross-platform complexity | High | Shared C++ core with platform-specific shells |
